# WhitehousePetitions
Repo following Project 7: Whitehouse Petitions - JSON and NSData on hackingwithswift.com

## Concepts Learned/Practiced
* Parsing JSON
* UITabBarController
* NSData
* ```guard``` keyword
* Continued use of ```if let``` for optional binding to see if an optional has a value and assigning to a variable or constant if it does have a value.
* Simple error handling
* Adding another tab to UITabBarController which displays another view controller(done in code)
