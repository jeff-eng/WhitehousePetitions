# WhitehousePetitions
Repo following Project 7: Whitehouse Petitions - JSON and NSData on www.hackingwithswift.com. The goal is to learn how to parse JSON and get familiarity with UITabBarController.

The second part of this project follows Project 9: Grand Central Dispatch at www.hackingwithswift.com.

## Concepts Learned/Practiced in Project 7
* Parsing JSON
* UITabBarController
* NSData
* ```guard``` keyword
* Continued use of ```if let``` for optional binding to see if an optional has a value and assigning to a variable or constant if it does have a value.
* Simple error handling
* Adding another tab to UITabBarController which displays another view controller(done in code)

## Concepts Learned/Practiced in Project 9
* Grand Central Dispatch(GCD) framework
  * ```dispatch_async()``` method
